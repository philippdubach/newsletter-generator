# Introduction

Friends have been asking how they can stay up to date with what I'm working on and keep track of the things I read, write and share. RSS feeds don't seem to be state of the art anymore, apparently. So I'm starting this mailing list.

Recently I've been spending some time on an autonomous AI-powered academic research system. The pipeline handles literature review, structured evidence extraction, optional computation, and paper assembly using a multi-agent architecture with 25 specialized agents. It's built as a filesystem-first system where most components write durable artifacts into project folders, making outputs inspectable and gates re-runnable (link see below). I've also been finishing up a paper on [Attention Dynamics in Online Communities](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5910263), looking at power laws, preferential attachment, and early success prediction on Hacker News. 

To my surprise, the site quietly crossed 10,000 unique monthly visitors in November. I didn't expect that, but it’s a nice motivator to keep going.
